# ESP32 Arduino CO2 & Temperature Project

This project uses an ESP32 with Arduino to measure **CO2 concentration** and **temperature**.

## Features
- Reads CO2 sensor values
- Reads temperature
- Sends/prints data via Serial/other interface

## Hardware
- ESP32
- [Your CO2 Sensor model]
- [Temperature Sensor model]

## How to Upload
